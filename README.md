# SideSeatDriverV1
An early experiment solving AI path finding using visual sight data (aka how we humans find our way around things).

This then morphed into attempting to create a real time rendering system without simply using JavaFX (because apparently I'm scecretly a glutton for punishment) which then led me into many interesting and painful exploriations into Java concurrency.

It was also the first project where I really learned the true reason you document things. Having to track down what a funciton is supposed to do for 6 hours rather than implementing the idea I had at the time got annoying real fast.
